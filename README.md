My name is Swetha, and I’m a graduate student in Information Systems, passionate about all things **Data Analytics** and **Data Science**.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

🎓 I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Information Systems and Data Science** at **Syracuse University**, New York.  
💼 I’m a **Data Analyst & Aspiring Data Scientist**, sharing my **projects, learning journey, and insights** online.  
🔬 I interned at **Zoetis** with their **Data Science & Analytics team**, where I helped researchers organize and visualize data to improve operational efficiency.  
🧠 I'm driven by curiosity — I love uncovering **patterns in data** (and sometimes in daily life too!).  
🌱 My motto: *Do something differently every day and improve by 0.1%*.  
🤝 I enjoy collaborating with fellow data enthusiasts and am always open to learning something new.
